# **Implementation of Secure Communication Between UAV and Operator**

Two parties, **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)** and **Operator**, communicate through a middleman called **Registration Authority (RA)** using **TCP SOCK_STREAM connections**.

The implementation is carried out using three different methods:

1. **AES CTR** (implemented from scratch without hardware acceleration).  
2. **Pure scalar multiplications** on the **SECP224k1 curve** and **BLAKE3 hash function**.  
3. **Partial scalar multiplication** + **ChaCha20-Poly1305 combined encryption and decryption**.

## **Comparison Results**

All methods are compared in terms of **Entropy (Randomness)** in Ciphertext and **Execution Time**. The results are as follows:
